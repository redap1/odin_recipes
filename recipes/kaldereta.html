    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beef Kaldereta is a dish that is served on special occassions, and it never fails to disappoint. The tender meat with a rich stew and tangy tomato-based sauce combine to make a heavenly medley in your mouth!</p>
    <p>This is a strong contender for my favorite dish. It does take a little more effort to make, but I promise that it's worth it. This dish is that good.</p>

    <h2>Some notes</h2>
    <p>There are many variations of this dish, and one of my favorite ones is adding a scoop of peanut butter and pickles. It sounds weird, but it works so well.</p>
    <p>With the tomato paste and crushed tomatoes, you can play around with their ratios until you achieve a mixture that you enjoy. Add more tomato paste for a thicker stew, but I wouldn't recomment going less than 2 tbsp.</p>
