    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beef giniling was one of the dishes that I made almost every week because of its addicting flavor and its ultra low effort to make. I could whip this dish up in 30 minutes, and it would taste so good for the amount of effort I put into it.</p>
    <p>Ideally, this recipe uses tomato sauce, but I find that you can substitute a tomato based pasta sauce instead and it always does the trick. I personally never used tomato sauce because we never had it in our pantry lol.</p>
    <p>Serves 4-6 people. Cooking Time: ~30 minutes</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs ground beef/pork</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, diced</li>
        <li>3 medium potatoes, diced</li>
        <li>2 large bell peppers, diced</li>
        <li> tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato sauce/pasta sauce</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp white sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pan or skillet, sautee garlic on medium-high heat until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef and cook until beef is browned and not too oily.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper, and add carrots, potatoes, and bell peppers.</li>
        <li>Add soy sauce, and mix everything together.</li>
        <li>After around 5 minutes, add the tomato sauce, and let simmer.</li>
        <li>After around 15 minutes, add sugar and more soy sauce to taste.</li>
        <li>Let vegetables get soft, then serve with white rice!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Some notes</h2>
    <p>I would say that for this dish especially, you can very much just eyeball everything. I promise it'll turn out fine. Also, the bell peppers aren't really required, but I would recommend having at least potatoes and carrots. If you're feeling fancy, you can add peas and/or raisins.</p>
