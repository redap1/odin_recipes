    <h1>My Filipino Recipes</h1>
    <p>These recipes were my go to's in college when I was missing home. I have 3 dishes on 3 different levels of effort to make, but all of these recipes are super easy.</p>
    <p>I recommend <em>not</em> following the recipe portions to the tee. They serve merely as suggestions. Real Filipino cooking, as my mom says, is organic. Once you are comfortable with these dishes, it is totally okay to eyeball amounts. In fact, I encourage it!</p>
    <p>All of these recipes are meant to be eaten with white rice ofc.</p>
